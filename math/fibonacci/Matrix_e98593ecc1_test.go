================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Integer Overflow
Issue: The operations on integers might cause an overflow which can lead to unexpected behavior.
Solution: Consider using big.Int for operations on large integers, and always check for potential overflows.

Vulnerability: Lack of Input Validation
Issue: The function doesn't validate the input, which can lead to unexpected results for negative values or very large values.
Solution: Validate the input to ensure it is within the expected range.

Vulnerability: Error Handling
Issue: The function doesn't handle potential errors such as an integer overflow.
Solution: Add proper error handling to the function.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Testing the Fibonacci function with small positive numbers

Details:
  TestName: TestFibonacciSmallPositiveNumbers
  Description: This test is meant to check the Fibonacci function when it takes small positive numbers as input. The Fibonacci series for the first few numbers should be generated correctly.

Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Invoke the Matrix function with a small positive number, like 5.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual result matches the expected outcome.

Validation:
  The assertion is based on the known values of the Fibonacci series. The expected result for an input of 5 is 5, which is the 5th Fibonacci number. This test is important to ensure that the function can generate the Fibonacci series correctly for small numbers.

Scenario 2: Testing the Fibonacci function with zero

Details:
  TestName: TestFibonacciWithZero
  Description: This test is meant to check the Fibonacci function when it takes zero as input. The output should be zero since the 0th Fibonacci number is 0.

Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Invoke the Matrix function with zero as the input.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual result is zero.

Validation:
  The assertion is based on the known value of the 0th Fibonacci number, which is 0. This test is important to ensure that the function can handle an input of zero correctly.

Scenario 3: Testing the Fibonacci function with large positive numbers

Details:
  TestName: TestFibonacciLargePositiveNumbers
  Description: This test is meant to check the Fibonacci function when it takes large positive numbers as input. The function should be able to generate the nth Fibonacci number without any errors or overflow.

Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Invoke the Matrix function with a large positive number, like 1000000.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual result is a non-negative number.

Validation:
  The assertion is based on the fact that all Fibonacci numbers are non-negative. The exact value of the 1000000th Fibonacci number is not known, but the function should return a non-negative number without any errors or overflow. This test is important to ensure that the function can handle large inputs correctly.

Scenario 4: Testing the Fibonacci function with maximum uint value

Details:
  TestName: TestFibonacciWithMaxUint
  Description: This test is meant to check the Fibonacci function when it takes the maximum uint value as input. The function should not overflow or return an error.

Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Invoke the Matrix function with the maximum uint value.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual result is a non-negative number.

Validation:
  The assertion is based on the fact that all Fibonacci numbers are non-negative. The function should not overflow or return an error when it takes the maximum uint value as input. This test is important to ensure that the function can handle the maximum possible input correctly.
