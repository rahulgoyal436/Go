Scenario 1: Test for Zero Input

Details:
  TestName: TestFormulaForZero
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly returns 0 when the input n is 0. According to the Fibonacci sequence, the first number is 0.

Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement needed as we are directly providing the input to the function.
  Act: Invoke the Formula function with the parameter 0.
  Assert: Assert that the result is 0.

Validation:
  The assertion checks if the result of the function for input 0 is 0. This is important as it verifies the correctness of the function for the first number in the Fibonacci sequence.

Scenario 2: Test for First Positive Number

Details:
  TestName: TestFormulaForOne
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly returns 1 when the input n is 1. According to the Fibonacci sequence, the second number is 1.

Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement needed as we are directly providing the input to the function.
  Act: Invoke the Formula function with the parameter 1.
  Assert: Assert that the result is 1.

Validation:
  The assertion checks if the result of the function for input 1 is 1. This is important as it verifies the correctness of the function for the second number in the Fibonacci sequence.

Scenario 3: Test for Larger Positive Numbers

Details:
  TestName: TestFormulaForLargerNumbers
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly calculates the Fibonacci number for larger positive inputs.

Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement needed as we are directly providing the input to the function.
  Act: Invoke the Formula function with a larger positive number like 10.
  Assert: Assert that the result is 55, which is the 10th Fibonacci number.

Validation:
  The assertion checks if the result of the function for input 10 is 55. This is important as it verifies the correctness of the function for larger numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.

Scenario 4: Test for Maximum uint Value

Details:
  TestName: TestFormulaForMaxUint
  Description: This test checks if the function handles the maximum uint value without overflow.

Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement needed as we are directly providing the input to the function.
  Act: Invoke the Formula function with the maximum uint value.
  Assert: Assert that the function does not result in an overflow.

Validation:
  The assertion checks if the function handles the maximum uint value without overflow. This is important as it verifies the robustness of the function in handling extreme cases.
