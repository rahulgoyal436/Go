ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=Matrix_e98593ecc1

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Lack of input validation
Issue: The function does not validate the input 'n'. In case a negative number is provided, it could lead to unexpected results or behavior.
Solution: Add input validation checks to ensure 'n' is within the expected range. For example, check if 'n' is not a negative number and less than the maximum value that the 'uint' type can hold.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Testing the Fibonacci function with small positive numbers

Details:
  TestName: TestFibonacciWithSmallPositiveNumbers
  Description: This test is meant to check the Fibonacci function's behavior when it's given small positive numbers. It verifies that the function correctly calculates the Fibonacci sequence.

Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Invoke the Matrix function with a small number like 5.
  Assert: Use the Go testing facilities to check that the returned value is the correct Fibonacci number.

Validation:
  The assertion checks that the returned value is the correct Fibonacci number for the given input. This is important because it ensures that the function correctly implements the Fibonacci sequence.

Scenario 2: Testing the Fibonacci function with large positive numbers

Details:
  TestName: TestFibonacciWithLargePositiveNumbers
  Description: This test is meant to check the Fibonacci function's behavior when it's given large positive numbers. It verifies that the function correctly calculates the Fibonacci sequence, even for large numbers.

Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Invoke the Matrix function with a large number like 50.
  Assert: Use the Go testing facilities to check that the returned value is the correct Fibonacci number.

Validation:
  The assertion checks that the returned value is the correct Fibonacci number for the given input. This is important because it ensures that the function can handle large numbers without overflowing or returning incorrect results.

Scenario 3: Testing the Fibonacci function with zero

Details:
  TestName: TestFibonacciWithZero
  Description: This test is meant to check the Fibonacci function's behavior when it's given zero as input. It verifies that the function correctly returns zero, as the zeroth Fibonacci number is zero.

Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Invoke the Matrix function with zero.
  Assert: Use the Go testing facilities to check that the returned value is zero.

Validation:
  The assertion checks that the returned value is zero. This is important because it ensures that the function correctly handles the special case of zero as input.

Scenario 4: Testing the Fibonacci function with one

Details:
  TestName: TestFibonacciWithOne
  Description: This test is meant to check the Fibonacci function's behavior when it's given one as input. It verifies that the function correctly returns one, as the first Fibonacci number is one.

Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Invoke the Matrix function with one.
  Assert: Use the Go testing facilities to check that the returned value is one.

Validation:
  The assertion checks that the returned value is one. This is important because it ensures that the function correctly handles the special case of one as input.
