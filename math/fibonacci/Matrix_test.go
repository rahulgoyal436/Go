================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: undefined
Issue: The 'math' package is imported but not used, which leads to unnecessary overhead.
Solution: Remove the 'import "math"' line from your code.

Vulnerability: undefined
Issue: The bitwise operation 'n&1' might be unclear to some developers. While it's not a security issue, code readability is an important aspect of maintaining a secure codebase.
Solution: Replace the 'n&1' operation with 'n%2' to make it clear that you're checking if 'n' is odd.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Testing the Fibonacci function with small positive numbers

Details:
  TestName: TestFibonacciWithSmallPositiveNumbers
  Description: This test is meant to check the Fibonacci function's behavior when it's called with small positive numbers.

Execution:
  Arrange: No setup or mocks are required for this test.
  Act: Call the Matrix function with small positive numbers (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5).
  Assert: Assert that the returned result matches the expected Fibonacci sequence.

Validation:
  The assertion is based on the known Fibonacci sequence. For example, calling the function with 2 should return 1, with 3 should return 2, with 4 should return 3, and with 5 should return 5. This test is important to verify the function's basic functionality with normal inputs.

Scenario 2: Testing the Fibonacci function with zero

Details:
  TestName: TestFibonacciWithZero
  Description: This test is meant to check the Fibonacci function's behavior when it's called with zero.

Execution:
  Arrange: No setup or mocks are required for this test.
  Act: Call the Matrix function with zero.
  Assert: Assert that the returned result is zero.

Validation:
  The assertion is based on the known Fibonacci sequence, where the first number is zero. This test is important to verify the function's behavior with edge inputs.

Scenario 3: Testing the Fibonacci function with large positive numbers

Details:
  TestName: TestFibonacciWithLargePositiveNumbers
  Description: This test is meant to check the Fibonacci function's behavior when it's called with large positive numbers.

Execution:
  Arrange: No setup or mocks are required for this test.
  Act: Call the Matrix function with large positive numbers (e.g., 100, 1000, 10000).
  Assert: Assert that the returned result is a positive number.

Validation:
  The assertion is based on the fact that the Fibonacci sequence only contains positive numbers. This test is important to verify the function's performance and behavior with large inputs.

Scenario 4: Testing the Fibonacci function with the maximum uint value

Details:
  TestName: TestFibonacciWithMaxUint
  Description: This test is meant to check the Fibonacci function's behavior when it's called with the maximum uint value.

Execution:
  Arrange: No setup or mocks are required for this test.
  Act: Call the Matrix function with the maximum uint value.
  Assert: Assert that the returned result is a positive number.

Validation:
  The assertion is based on the fact that the Fibonacci sequence only contains positive numbers. This test is important to verify the function's behavior with the maximum possible input.
