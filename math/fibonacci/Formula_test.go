================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Floating Point Precision Error
Issue: The use of floating point numbers and the math.Sqrt and math.Pow functions can lead to precision errors, especially for large inputs. This is not a security issue, but it can lead to incorrect results.
Solution: Consider using a more precise method for calculating Fibonacci numbers, such as an iterative approach or matrix exponentiation. If floating point numbers must be used, consider using a library or package that provides arbitrary precision arithmetic.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test for valid Fibonacci number

Details:
  TestName: TestValidFibonacciNumber
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the Formula function when given valid positive non-zero input. The function should return the correct Fibonacci number.

Execution:
  Arrange: We don't need to arrange any data or mocks for this test.
  Act: Invoke the Formula function with a valid positive non-zero number, like 5.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual results match the expected outcomes.

Validation:
  We would use the assert.Equal method from the testify library to validate the result. The expected result of Formula(5) should be 5, which is the 5th number in the Fibonacci sequence. This test is important to ascertain the basic functionality of the Formula function.

Scenario 2: Test for zero input

Details:
  TestName: TestZeroInput
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the Formula function when given a zero as input. The function should return 0.

Execution:
  Arrange: We don't need to arrange any data or mocks for this test.
  Act: Invoke the Formula function with 0.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual results match the expected outcomes.

Validation:
  We would use the assert.Equal method from the testify library to validate the result. The expected result of Formula(0) should be 0. This test is important to verify the function's behavior when given zero as input.

Scenario 3: Test for very large input

Details:
  TestName: TestLargeInput
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the Formula function when given a very large number as input. The function should handle the large input without causing an overflow error.

Execution:
  Arrange: We don't need to arrange any data or mocks for this test.
  Act: Invoke the Formula function with a very large number, like 1e9.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function doesn't cause an overflow error.

Validation:
  We would use the assert.NoError method from the testify library to validate the result. The expected result of Formula(1e9) should not cause an error. This test is important to verify the function's behavior when given very large inputs.
