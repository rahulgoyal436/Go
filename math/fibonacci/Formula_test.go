================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Incorrect Results for Large Inputs
Issue: The function uses floating-point arithmetic to calculate Fibonacci numbers. This could lead to incorrect results for large input values due to the imprecision of floating-point numbers.
Solution: Consider using a different algorithm to calculate Fibonacci numbers that does not rely on floating-point arithmetic. For example, you could use an iterative approach that only requires integer operations.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test for Zero Input

Details:
  TestName: TestFormulaForZero
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly returns 0 when the input n is 0. According to the Fibonacci sequence, the first number is 0.

Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement needed as we are directly providing the input to the function.
  Act: Invoke the Formula function with the parameter 0.
  Assert: Assert that the result is 0.

Validation:
  The assertion checks if the result of the function for input 0 is 0. This is important as it verifies the correctness of the function for the first number in the Fibonacci sequence.

Scenario 2: Test for First Positive Number

Details:
  TestName: TestFormulaForOne
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly returns 1 when the input n is 1. According to the Fibonacci sequence, the second number is 1.

Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement needed as we are directly providing the input to the function.
  Act: Invoke the Formula function with the parameter 1.
  Assert: Assert that the result is 1.

Validation:
  The assertion checks if the result of the function for input 1 is 1. This is important as it verifies the correctness of the function for the second number in the Fibonacci sequence.

Scenario 3: Test for Larger Positive Numbers

Details:
  TestName: TestFormulaForLargerNumbers
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly calculates the Fibonacci number for larger inputs. For instance, the 10th Fibonacci number is 55.

Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement needed as we are directly providing the input to the function.
  Act: Invoke the Formula function with the parameter 10.
  Assert: Assert that the result is 55.

Validation:
  The assertion checks if the result of the function for input 10 is 55. This is important as it verifies the correctness of the function for larger numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.

Scenario 4: Test for Maximum uint Value

Details:
  TestName: TestFormulaForMaxUint
  Description: This test checks if the function handles the maximum uint value appropriately. The function should not overflow or return an error.

Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement needed as we are directly providing the input to the function.
  Act: Invoke the Formula function with the parameter math.MaxUint64.
  Assert: Assert that the function does not panic and returns a uint value.

Validation:
  The assertion checks if the function can handle large input values without causing a panic or overflow. This is important for verifying the robustness of the function.
